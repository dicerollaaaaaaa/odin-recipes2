# Odin Recipes
## Utilities Used
I think I'll just setup some structure in the HTML and continue to iterate on the structure as I continue to learn new things.

## Future Features
I'd like to see the following:
- LCD Ingredient Scaling
- Rating System
- Somehow sync with a grocery site to add to cart/calculate cost
